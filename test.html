<p>This is a paragraph that contains <span>several span tags</span>.
I'd like to style these span tags across my <span>entire site at once</span>,
 to establish a default  site-wide format for them. The most efficient selector
  for this would be the <span>element selector</span>, as it will allow me to
  establish a base-line format for the span tag with a <span>low degree of
 specificity</span>. This means that the formatting will be controlled
 throughout the entire site with a single selector, and it will be <span>easy
 to overwrite in specific instances</span> where I want the styling to change.</p>
