        <p>
          Have you ever found yourself walking around an area filled with bars but can't seem to find the best special around town? You can look up dozens of different bar websites to find out drink/food specials. Also, you can call each bar, annoying the hell
          out of somebody. You can walk to each bar and study their outdoor sign exposing the special. There must be a better way?
        </p>

          Instead, Spesh allows the user to easily search for the best specials in a proximity of his/her choice. Spesh provides a unique experience to night life to consumers. We connect the bars directly with the consumer for a definite approach. Increasing bar
          visibility while increasing door swings. Who doesn't like a win win approach?
