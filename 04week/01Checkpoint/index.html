  <h2>About Uncle TY's Cakes &amp; Pies</h2>
  <p>Uncle Ty grew up baking with his grandmother for his extended family of over 100 close relatives. His passion grew into a business. In 1999, Uncle Ty finally opened his own bakery. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>Back in the 70s, when head was a little one, Ty's uncle would huff glue and come by and pick me up to go ride around in his Beetle WITHOUT TELLING HIS PARENTS. Much excitement was had until he got the hang of checking in with his parents.</p>
