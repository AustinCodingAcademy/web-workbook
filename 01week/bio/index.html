    <p> My name is Greg Devany.  My roots were set in Central Texas in 1977 when
    my family moved to Round Rock, Texas.  There, I attended Deepwood Elementary,
    Chisholm Trail Middle School, and Round Rock High School. College courses
    were studied at Concordia Lutheran College, Austin Community College, and
    Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University).  Although I
    have over 100 credit hours (BBA/CIS), I never received a degree.  Non-college
    classes include a Java Development Series in 2015 at ACC (270+ hours,
    full-stack) and Full-Stack Developer bootcamp at Austin Coding Academy in
    2017 (9 month course). In 1995 I married my best friend, and have two
    beautiful girls attending Bowie High School and Texas ATM University.
    </p>
    <p>I have owned several small businesses over the past 20+ years, with the
    most prevalent being Greg Devany Engineering (1994-2012).  Currently I own
    and operate Easy Life Pool Services, serving clients in South Austin.  For a

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family most of all.  When I
    need a break from them, I enjoy fishing, biking, camping, and poker.
