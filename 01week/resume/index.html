      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        Passionate and friendly, I'm a fresh high school graduate. I love to solve problems and help people out. I'm an artist, writer and aspiring programmer. My first work in coding was in Python, and I'm currently at Austin Code Academy to get my feet wet with HTML, CSS, Javascript and C#. I'm adaptable and quick learning, and would love to help your company reach it's goals.
