              <p>As a Cable Technician I troubleshot residential customers' cable and vo-ip systems. Levels would be gathered from the tap to the home to the outlet to verify correct signal levels at each point. Replacement of CPE (customer premise equipment)
                may also be necessary as well as replacing cable lines and CAT V for telephony/ethernet. Additionally, basic networking troubleshooting may be necessary such as release or renew of IP. My technical expertise and motivation to address all
                issues in a single visit was recognized by my superiors through a weekly performance metric. Additionally, of the course of the nearly year and a half there, all of my customers that were surveyed gave me the highest possible ranking .</p>

                <!-- Description of Lease Operator -->
                As a Lease Operator/Field Specialist, I was responsible for oil production on multiple leases. The job involved me driving 250+ miles a week as I maintained equipment necessary to keep production metrics up. This involved me troubleshooting down hole
                pumps, production vessels and chemical treatment.

              <p>Studied the foundation and inner workings of modern automated systems. Field of study includes alternating current, direct current, and programmable logic controllers. As a final, I led a three person team to program the ladder logic of
                five independent processing stations to perform their individual process then complete a handshake with the following station. We were the first team to ever complete the project.

              I find that giving weekly updates to my progress on a project will give others a rough timeline as to when to expect a merging of works

              As an avid fan of RTS' I understand the value of learning hotkeys and their implementation. Storing macros is the next step.
