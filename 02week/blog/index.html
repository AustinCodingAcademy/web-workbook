            <p>This a place that I share my thoughts to the world about cyber security and how software dev ops affects the interwebs. Web applications are often vulnerable to a commonly found attack, Cross Site Scripting (aka XSS), which leverages the lack of output encoding and input validation within a web application. The exploit allows a malicious actor (hacker) to embed JavaScript content (payloads) into the end-users browser and execute malicious code. Often, this results in phishing for users credentials, credit card information, malware distribution, and other malicious activities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities is usually fairly simple, yet yields devastating impact to end-users.</p>

            <h2>Dev-Sec.io Automated Hardening Framework</h2>
            <h5>SecDevOps, Aug 29, 2018</h5>
            <p>Automated configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef and Puppet are changing the way that organizations provision and manage their IT infrastructure. These tools allow engineers to programmatically define how systems are set up, and automatically install and configure software packages. System provisioning and configuration becomes testable, auditable, efficient, scalable and consistent, from tens to hundreds or thousands of hosts.

                These tools also change the way that system hardening is done. Instead of following a checklist or a guidebook like one of the CIS Benchmarks, and manually applying or scripting changes, you can automatically enforce hardening policies or audit system configurations against recognized best practices, using pre-defined hardening rules programmed into code.</p>
