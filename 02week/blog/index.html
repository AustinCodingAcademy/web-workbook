    <p class="hello">As you can see I'm obsessed with vegan and gluten-free recipes. I try to eat vegan/vegetarian at the house at all times, and mostly vegetarian out in public, simply for health reasons.<br> 
    <br>
    I'm also allergic to wheat, barley and rye (gluten) therefore I have to be incredibly careful aout what I eat otherwise it will make me sick.<br>
    <br>
    I have a link in here to my tattoo artist, because she's awesome! Go see her! Seriously.<br>
    <br>
    I've also linked my favorite youtube channel, Matt & Blue. I love falling asleep to their videos. They're like the perfect same-sex couple raising an awesome kid.<br>
    <br>
    And I of course couldn't leave out my current tv obsession, which JUST ended: Sharp Objects. Amy Adams was PHENOMENAL! Oh, and my favorite color is black. :-)</p>
