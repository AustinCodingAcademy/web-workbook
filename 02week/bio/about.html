      <h1>Christopher Bergamo</h1>
      <p>is an Austin, Texas based singer/songwriter, audio engineer, and musical hardware creator.
        He is a current member Bitter Leaves, a band a part
        of a not-so-short list of acts ushering in the new wave of psychedelic rock.
        Christopher's music presents a pallet of mystic romanticism,
        a Gnostic Ordeal set in 21st century American rock and roll. </p>

      <h2> Thrash Years</h2>
      At age 17 Christopher started his professional music career as writer and guitarist for
      the hardcore band HoldxFast. Regarded as a powerhouse in the Texas hardcore music scene,
      HoldxFast was signed to Teishu Records out of Connecticut a month before their first live show and released
      a split 7" with Corpus Christi youth-crew act The Contender. The album marked a resurgence in Texas
      "straight-edge"
      hardcore and went on to do several US tours before it gave way to upcoming cross-over band Iron Age, of which
      Christopher
      was a founding member and first drummer.
      <hr>
      <h2>Seeking A Change</h2>
      Upon entering Texas State University, Christopher was introduced to the jangly Brit-pop resurgence of the
      early 2000's. Beatle-head bands like Blur and Oasis, and the shambolic sounds of The Libertines and The Cribs
      prompted Christopher and dorm-mate Derek Blackwell to form the band Them Shakes.
      A band characterised by it's innocense, the writing duo penned many snarky love songs, noteably "Why Can't It Be
      Her",
      "Miami 1967", and "Only Lovers Know". Although the group never signed or released a full length LP, or signed to
      a label,
      their following in and around San Marcos opened doors for the next chapter of Christopher's musical career.
      <hr>
      <h2>Smoking White</h2>
      Christopher reunited with Them Shakes guitarist Nicholas Brown
      to form Smoking White. Depressive downer rock with softly sang melodies over screeching fuzzed guitars, the
      shoe-gazing
      stoner rock group became a fixture at Austin venues like Hotel Vegas, Cheer-Up Charlies, and the now ressurected
      Spider House Ballroom.
      The band found moderate success with the release of their full length "Soft Chains", played multiple SXSW
      showcases, and
      opened for international acts such as Ty Segall's Fuzz and Turbogeist. Despite their momentum and a second full
      length album in the works
      Smoking White came to an abrupt end in the summer of 2015.
      <hr>
      <h2>Present</h2>
      After a decade of writing, recording, and gigging Christopher is now focusing his energy on creative design and
      web development.
      Never far from music he's in the early stages of developing apps and websites for songwriters and musicians to
      collaborate
      freely across the web.
