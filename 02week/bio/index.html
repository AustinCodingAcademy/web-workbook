<!--
Wishlist:
- Add semantics tags
- Add accessibility attribs
- Add microdata (did these break my resume index.html? How to test?)
- Link all projects on web-workbook index.html
- Remove blue border from <details> click
- Link google fonts once in web-workbook index.html (how to get
the rest of the index files to reference the fonts on the
web-workbook index?)
- Make floating <div>s get narrower but still span the width of
the screen as I zoom in
- Is there some way to force .box-1 to switch <p> from block to
inline if zoom causes .box-2 to stop floating, with the effect
that zooming in makes the icon links appear horizontally to the
right of the photo as soon as .box-2 runs out of room to
float, in place of stacking vertically as blocks below the photo?

          <p>I've provided operations and administration support, coordination and
            analysis for executive directors, vice presidents, managers and large teams
            for 16 years.</p>
          <p>As an Analyst and Coordinator at Dell EMC Services, I support a global
            Consulting team of nearly 400 with operational analysis, reporting,
            logistics and coordination for their customer experience, partner
            management and technical training needs.</p>
          <p>As an Account Development Specialist at ARCADIS, I cultivated
            partnerships with several Principal Account Managers, Project Managers
            and internal stakeholders to deliver timely, quality proposals under
            strict deadlines, advocating by example for the added value of the
            ADS role.</p>
          <p>As a Document Coordinator for ARCADIS (a global engineering consultant),
            I managed technical report processing, formatting, workflow and procedure
            locally and enterprise-wide to ensure the highest-quality content and
            presentation for all client deliverables.</p>
          <p>"Seville must love pain. He consistently gets assigned to some of [the]
            most difficult areas... [which] are critical to our business, yet none of
            them are done very well by [our company]. Seville has brought an element of
            discipline and process we have not seen in the past. He is clearly
            passionate about his work and... good at working across towers collaboratively.
            We need more folks like Seville."
