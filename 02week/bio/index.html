    <h1>Hello Friend!</h1>
    <p> My name is Ty Sweet, and I'm currently attending Austin Coding Academy to become a full-stack developer in (obviously) Austin, TX. I'm originally from California and have been here almost two years.  Austin is a great place because it feels a lot like California, mostly because almost everyone here is from California!  My most recent employment background has been in various sales roles and I spent quite a bit of time in the energy industry.  I'm currently married with three awesome girls who will one day bankrupt me.  Below is a link to my resume and a few ways to contact me, as well as a link to a Prince video.  Because why not?</p>
