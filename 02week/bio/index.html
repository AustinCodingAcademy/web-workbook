      Working towards San Antonio Coding Academy Graduation.
    </h2>
      <p>I have always wanted to do something in a career field with computers
      though most of my work life has been with fast food. Im glad to be able to
      say that I am moving forward in my life and working towards a career in technology.</p>
      <h3> Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I love playing video games, since i was about three years old i have
      been playing video games.  It has been a huge hobby of mine because i got
    to play with friends a siblings as well and get closer to each of them through
  that.  I also loved to play baseball and basketball when I was younger.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
      What I am mostly working towards is an ability to take care of my family
      and spend time with them as much as I can while working in a career that I love.
