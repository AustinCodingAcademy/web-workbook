                <p>I've worn several hats in my professional life. After college
                    I instructed high school art in my hometown of Newton, Texas. Sharing the benefits
                    of creative thought and expression with my students is one of the most rewarding
                    experiences I've ever had. I smile when I think back on this time of my life, knowing
                    that I have made a positive impact in the lives many.</p>

                <p>In addition to teaching art, I am also a practicing artist. My body of work is
                    varied consisting of large-scale abstract paintings, charcoal and graphite figure drawings,
                    sculptures constructed of wood, cement and steel, tattoo designs, home furnishings and my personal
                    favorite, pet portraits. Art gives me life.</p>

                <p>I've had the pleasure for the past four years of working in the fitness industry, providing
                    a safe and encouraging space for the self improvement of others.</p>
