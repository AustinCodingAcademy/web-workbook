 <p> I was born in Atlatna, Georgia in 1993. I lived there for all of 3 weeks,
   when my famliy moved to Mississippi for a while, and then eventually moved to
   San Antonio where I was raised. I've been working since I was 15 years old. I've all was had one goal being more than I am right now.
   I'm currntly working on becoming a web programer to get me out of the minum-wage loop I've been in for far to long.<p>This is a playlist that shows a little of who I am
