    <h1>Oliver Magoo<h1>
    <h2>Senior Dog<h2>
    <p>I am a domesticated dog. My name is Oliver Magoo. I often go by Buddy Ollie, or just plain Ollie. I've mastered a wide variety of skills including stay, roll-over, human, and my personal favorite, ballerina. I have been honored with many treats in my 6-year career as a dog. In my free time, I enjoy belly rubs, taking up the whole couch, modeling, chasing dogs who like to chase balls, and hanging out in the kitchen while the humans are cooking. I have a little sister named Oala Bear. She's annoying. But she lets me be senior dog. And I like that. So she's cool I guess.</p>
