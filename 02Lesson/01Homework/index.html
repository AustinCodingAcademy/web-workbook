  <p style="text-align: center; background-color: #ccb3ff"><em>I'm 25 years old and almost get gigantic fireworks for my birthday because it's on July 3rd, I say they're for my birthday ayways though. My first love would have to be travel. I am a firm believer that once you start traveling and seeing more of the world you won't want to quit. I've been to 12 different countries so far and I want that number to be close to 100 by the time I'm old and literally can't travel anymore. I want to code because I see a spark of excitement when I talk about it. I didn't realize how much I like creating beautiful things and I'm seeing that more and more when I code and see my work pop up on Chrome. I honeslty really hope this is my calling and in a few years I'm able to call myself a stack developer. That's my dream.</em>
